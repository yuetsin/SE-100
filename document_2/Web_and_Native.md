# Homework 2
## Introduction

Sometimes it's really hard to decide which kind of technique should we choose. Is it good to stay in the traditional track
and build all my business code as binaries before distributing them, or is it fine if we put them all "online" and just grab the
input and display the result in a so-called "WebView" (like a virtual internet content browser fixed in your app)? In the final part
of this passage, I'd like to introduce a new way to "hybrid" the two techniques above.

## Native? Web?

I can still recall a time when the performance of mobile devices are not so well-developed (approximately in 2010s, the beginning
of Chinese mobile network), some application will boast them as developed in the "Full Native Code". That's not surprising since
at that time, placing an Internet page in your application will always cause notable stucks. But is that prejudice still correct *today*?  I mean, does the major growing up of mobile devices' processing ability have already changed the situation?

Let's take some typical kind of famous programming language used for developing native and web programs.
For Apple's iOS / macOS platform, the officially confirmed application developing language is Objective-C and Swift.
As for Web development, with merely JavaScript + HTML can build a decent web page that can be used in our web-based application.
