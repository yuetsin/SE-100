## Introduction

Sometimes it's really hard to decide which kind of technique should we choose. Is it good to stay in the traditional track
and build all my business code as binaries before distributing them, or is it fine if we put them all "online" and just grab the
input and display the result in a so-called "WebView" (like a virtual internet content browser fixed in your app)? In the final part
of this passage, I'd like to introduce a new way to "hybrid" the two techniques above.
