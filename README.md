# vue-project-demo
This project is trying to make a fair comparison with Vue.js and Swift. :)

 * /documents/document.md

The main homework 1 markdown file.

 * /document_2

Contains the stuff related to homework 2: "The Native and the Web".


 * /project/*
 
 Some demo project file that doesn't make much sense and should be ignored by all means.
